You can easily improve on the dataset by modifying the conversation.json file to make the model a lot better. You can also improve the model by adding more layers like LSTMs and Dropouts


The link for the github repository is down below. 
https://github.com/YashSolanki2007/Chatbot

Also after running the model once comment down the model.fit() code and the model = keras.Sequential([...]) code and uncomment the model = keras.models.load_model() code so that the model will not have to train everytime",,2021-08-19T12:53:14Z,,,0,0,0,4,33,70
